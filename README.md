# Minimal Mistakes remote theme starter

Click [**Use this template**](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) button above for the quickest method of getting started with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

Contains basic configuration to get you a site with:

- Sample posts.
- Sample top navigation.
- Sample author sidebar with social links.
- Sample footer links.
- Paginated home page.
- Archive pages for posts grouped by year, category, and tag.
- Sample about page.
- Sample 404 page.
- Site wide search.

Replace sample content with your own and [configure as necessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).

## Deployment

This site deploys through the **`Deploy Jekyll site to Pages`** GitHub Actions
workflow (`.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`), which builds with the project
`Gemfile` (Ruby 3.3, `minimal-mistakes-jekyll`).

GitHub Pages must be configured with **Source = "GitHub Actions"**
(Settings → Pages). Do not switch it back to "Deploy from a branch": the
legacy `github-pages` gem builder cannot load the `minimal-mistakes-jekyll`
theme gem, so it fails on every push and produces a red `pages build and
deployment` check even though the Actions deploy succeeds.
